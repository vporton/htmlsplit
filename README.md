# htmlsplit
HTML-split XSLT templates is an XSLT template (a program written in XSLT programming language),
which splits an XHTML file into several "chapters" and also creates a table of content (ToC).

It is fully configurable and themeable with config files and XML templates.

However, this version 0.1 is yet preliminary and untested. Instructions on installation and use are partial.
